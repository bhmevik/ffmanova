Description: General linear modeling with multiple responses (MANCOVA).  An
        overall p-value for each model term is calculated by the 50-50 MANOVA
        method, which handles collinear responses.  Rotation testing is used
        to compute adjusted single response p-values according to familywise
        error rates and false discovery rates.

Description: This package performs general linear modeling with
        multiple responses (MANCOVA).  An overall p-value for each
        model term is calculated by the 50-50 MANOVA method, which
        handles collinear responses.  Rotation testing is used to
        compute adjusted single response p-values according to
        familywise error rates and false discovery rates.
